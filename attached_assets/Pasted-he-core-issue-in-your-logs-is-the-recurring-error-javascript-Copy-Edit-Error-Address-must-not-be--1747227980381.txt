he core issue in your logs is the recurring error:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Error: Address must not be null or undefined
This is thrown when creating a transaction in the Algorand SDK, specifically here:

ruby
Copy
Edit
at ensureAddress (/node_modules/algosdk/src/transaction.ts:76:11)
Key places where the issue occurs:
During escrow opt-in to USDC:

ts
Copy
Edit
Error opting escrow into USDC: Error: Address must not be null or undefined
When preparing the escrow deployment:

ts
Copy
Edit
Error: Failed to prepare escrow deployment: Address must not be null or undefined
Likely Cause
You’re attempting to use an undefined or null address in makeAssetTransferTxnWithSuggestedParamsFromObject or makePaymentTxnWithSuggestedParamsFromObject.

This could mean one of the following is missing:

from

to (likely the problem)

assetReceiver

assetSender

or you're using an uninitialized variable when calling the transaction constructor.

Steps to Debug
In your optInEscrowToUSDC() and prepareCompleteEscrowDeployment() functions, check:

Is the escrow address defined and in string format?

Before calling algosdk.makeAssetTransferTxnWithSuggestedParamsFromObject(...), add:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (!escrowAddress) throw new Error("Escrow address is undefined");
Double check your use of address.toString() or algosdk.encodeAddress()

If you’re passing algosdk.Address instead of a string, it might not be working correctly. You should use:

ts
Copy
Edit
const escrowAddressStr = algosdk.encodeAddress(escrowAddress.publicKey);
Log input to the transaction constructor:
Just before creating the transaction, log:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.log('Creating opt-in txn with:', {
  from: sender,
  to: receiver,
  assetIndex: USDC_ASSET_ID,
  ...
});
Example Fix
Here’s how you might safely construct a transfer transaction:

ts
Copy
Edit
const optInTxn = algosdk.makeAssetTransferTxnWithSuggestedParamsFromObject({
  from: escrowAddressStr,
  to: escrowAddressStr, // self-opt-in
  assetIndex: USDC_ASSET_ID,
  amount: 0,
  suggestedParams
});
Be sure escrowAddressStr is defined and not an object.

Summary
The error means a null or undefined address is passed somewhere.

Ensure all addresses are properly extracted and converted to strings.

Use logging before transaction creation to confirm all values.

If you paste the relevant code for optInEscrowToUSDC() or prepareCompleteEscrowDeployment(), I can point to the exact fix.
